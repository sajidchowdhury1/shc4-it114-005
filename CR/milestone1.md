<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>Server-side is listening for the same port connection from the client side. The<br>server gets started in a main method with the port 3000 when the<br>program runs. So when clients type the commend with port 3000, they will<br>connect to the server socket of the same port.<div><br></div><div>The client has to first<br>put name for themselves by using the /name commend, then they cam use<br>the /connect commend. The /commend allows the client to join via IP address<br>or localhost. The commend is typed out like /connect localhost:3000. The localhost tells<br>the program that the client is joining on the same machine as the<br>server program and the 3000 say which port to join. This message is<br>a commend so it goes through processCommend in order to start the connection<br>which has the connect method. The connect method takes in the address and<br>port, which is used to set the set the connection to the server.</div><div><br></div><div>Steps:</div><div>1.<br>The server is started in terminal and listening for sockets with the port<br>3000.</div><div>2. The client is started and listening for inputs.</div><div>3. The name of the<br>user is set by /name (name).</div><div>4. The client types in /connect with either<br>IP address or localhost with :3000 all together.</div><div>5. The server sees client has<br>connected and waits for messages from the client.</div><br></p><br></td></tr>

<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 2: </em> Briefly explain how the messages are sent, broadcasted (sent to all connected clients), and received</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>From the client, they have to type in the terminal when it is<br>saying &quot;waiting for input&quot;. Once a message is typed and entered, the client<br>terminal (sending) shows what message they sent with their name. On another client<br>screening (receiving), it shows the clients name and the message. Also debug message<br>appears everyone including the server. From ServerThread, the server terminal shows the messages<br>that are coming from each room. From the room perspective, messages are sent<br>to the clients of the same room. So people in the lobby room<br>were able to see each other messages. But once someone joins another room,<br>the clients could not see each other messages.<div><br></div><div><br></div><br></p><br></td></tr>

</td></tr>
</table></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 2: </em> Briefly explain how the various disconnects/terminations are handled</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>Since the client is set to a room, there is a Room.java file<br>that handles all commends related to rooms and disconnecting or leaving leaving the<br>room. So when a client types /disconnect, /logout, or /logoff, it goes through<br>a method which is disconnectClient() method. This method removes the room that they<br>are in than it does a disconnect method, which is from ServerThread. So<br>from there the method prints out a message, set isRunning to false, and<br>does a cleanup method. The cleanup method is from the client file. The<br>close method is from client, that closes all objects related to the connection.<br>Such as server the object that is a socket used to connect to<br>the server program.<div><br></div><div>When the server crashes/disconnects/terminates, the clients do not crash because they<br>are programmed to keep running until they get connected again using commend. The<br>client program is not connected to the server program but it uses sockets<br>to connect to the server program.&nbsp;<br><div><br></div><div>When clients disconnect, they do not crash the<br>server since they are a separate and not apart of the server file.<br>Which means that they work independently from each other. Client uses sockets in<br>order to connect but that does not mean it is apart of the<br>server. So once disconnected, the clients would leave the connection from the server<br>while it keeps running. If there are multiple clients and one disconnects, then<br>the server will keep running with the remaining clients that are still connected.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div></div><br></p><br></td></tr>

<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>The problem I ran into was when creating the folders and setting up<br>the files since some had issues not having access to the other files<br>that were in different folders. I asked the professor how to get it<br>fixed, and I had to make an import of the reference of those<br>folders and file specifically to make it work. Also through practicing the code<br>a little bit, I gained more of an understanding of how rooms worked.<br></p><br></td></tr>
