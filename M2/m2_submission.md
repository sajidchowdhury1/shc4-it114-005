<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>The odd values were chosen from the use of for loop. As this<br>loop was iterating through the integers, it checked the integer would divide by<br>2 using module to see if the remainder equaled 1. If there was<br>a remainder of 1, that means it would be odd since 0 would<br>mean its even.&nbsp; After the condition, it would print out the odd values<br>from each of the arrays.<br></p><br></td></tr>

<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>For totaling, I used a for-loop to go through each numbers of the<br>array. Use indexing, I would multiplied each number by 1000 and added to<br>the total variable. Outside the for-loop, I would divide the total by 1000<br>to get the decimals back. But these were unformatted.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>To format the decimals to<br>two places, I did some research and found how to do String formatting.<br>So the output variable would equal to String.format(%.2f, total). The &quot;%&quot; started the<br>the formatting, the &quot;.2&quot; means that it would round to two decimal places,<br>and &quot;f&quot; means floating decimals, so allows the format to come out to<br>be decimals.&nbsp; There are other formatting options. The sources I used are commented<br>in the problem which are links to the websites.</div><br></p><br></td></tr>

<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>I did some research and found some sources to help me in some<br>parts of solving this problem. Using a for-loop, there are conditions that would<br>determine where the different datatypes would go through to be converted properly. In<br>the if conditions, I used arr[i].getClass().getSimpleName(). The .getClass() would find where the class<br>is coming from, like arrays would come from java.util.Arrays and .getSimpleName would get<br>the name, which would be Arrays. The result came out as string, so<br>the Integer data type would come out as as &quot;Integer&quot; in string format.<br>Using .equal() and writing &quot;Integer&quot; creates a boolean to see if the strings<br>match each other. There are three if and else if conditions checking the<br>String names of the data types (Integer, Doubles and String). After that, conversation<br>are done by using a Math method and use absolutes value method. I<br>did x = Math.abs(arr[i]) and depending on which datatype it was, I assigned<br>x to the primitive data type and I had to casting on arr[i]<br>since it is generic and needed to be specified for Math.abs() to work.<br>Than I started another variable y, which would convert it back to the<br>Wrapper or String. for example, Integer y = new Integer(x). Lastly, output[i] =<br>y was used since output was the object array and it would be<br>on the same iteration as the arr array, which means it would be<br>in the same order as it was before. So the String if conditions<br>part worked different because math.abs() does not take in string data type, so<br>I used Integer.parseInt() which converts the string into an int. So after math.abs()<br>was done, it gets converted back to a string by concatenation to an<br>empty string. Those were the differences from the other data type, other than<br>that the steps were similar in each if condition.<br></p><br></td></tr>

<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>I learn a few more java techniques from this homework assignment. I had<br>some issues doing problems 2 and 3 because they were out of the<br>scope of what I knew. So to resolve this problem, I did some<br>research into each of the problem and left little citations as comments in<br>the homework problems. I also asked the professor some questions which helped me<br>understand the problem a little bit more.<br></p><br></td></tr>
