<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <div>I did displayer higher or lower as my first implementation.</div><div><br></div>I created a separate<br>method called hint which does not return any values but prints out if<br>a the guess needs to be higher or lower. The method takes in<br>an int value as a permeameter, which is meant for guess variable to<br>be used with this method. So once the guess value is used with<br>this method, it checks in the if condition if the value is higher<br>than the random number or lower than the random number. Than it prints<br>either "higher" or "lower".&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>This method is placed inside of processGuess() and found in<br>the else block since that means the user guessed the number wrong.

<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <div>For my second implementation, I decided to do difficulty sector.</div><div><br></div>The method is implemented<br>inside of the start() and it is suppose to be used with the<br>scanner that is being opened with the try-with-resource. The difficulty method takes in<br>scanner objects as a parameter. I tried to do a try-with-resource inside my<br>method but it was causing conflicts with the start method which led to<br>many bugs. Using the same scanner as the start() worked better and did<br>not cause any more bugs.<div><br></div><div>In the difficulty method, it will ask the user<br>which difficulty the player would want to play from easy, medium, or hard.<br>It runs a while loop that is true and needs to be broken<br>out of. The if conditions has mode.trim().toUpperCase().equals("EASY"), which means mode is the string<br>input from the user, .trim() gets rid of white spaces, and .toUpperCase() makes<br>every letter of the input, upper case. Than .equals() checks if the input<br>string matches with the uppercased strings such as "EASY". Once its true, the<br>program changes the max strikes, prints out a statement on how many tries<br>they have from the selected difficulty, and breaks out of the while loop.<br>All these code works the same for each of the if conditions for<br>medium and hard. The else block runs when users do not type the<br>write mode, so it prints a error message and a selection message. It<br>does not break out of the loop and goes back to the top<br>where the mode input variable is located. It loops until the user types<br>the correct mode.</div><br></td></tr>

<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>For this homework assignment, everything seemed like it can work but my program<br>kept running into some bugs. I had many bugs when I tested my<br>codes for the difficulty sector, some of which are with the try-with-resource and<br>the scanner objects. To resolve this I asked the professor for some helped<br>and I learned a few things while trying to fix it. Ultimately, I<br>reworked the code multiple times until I got it to run without any<br>bugs.<br></p><br></td></tr>
