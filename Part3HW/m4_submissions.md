<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>The first implementation I did was Number Guesser.<div><br></div><div>There are multiple else if conditions<br>that were placed into processing commends block that would be used to start,<br>end, and reply with guesses. All these return true, so it can be<br>processed as a commend for users.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Starting the game:</div><div>- There is a private in<br>variable called randomNum that holds -1, this is used to show the game<br>is not active. There is a private variable because it is used to<br>store the random number when the game is running. When someone types &quot;start<br>game&quot;, the string goes through the if conditions that has start game, then<br>it start the game by redeclaring randomNum to a random value from 1-10<br>using Math.random(). Then it broadcasts to everyone that Number guesser has started and<br>to choose between 1-10.</div><div><br></div><div>Ending the game:</div><div>- When someone types exit game, if condition<br>is checked with the matching string and starts the process of stopping the<br>game. There is a message broadcasted to everyone saying game stopped and randomNum<br>is set back to -1. Setting randomNum back to its original state works<br>with the Guessing if condition to stop the guess from working.</div><div><br></div><div>Guessing number:</div><div>- The<br>else if condition checks if the message starts with word &quot;guess&quot; and that<br>randomNum is greater than -1. This is to prevent the game from running<br>when someone has stopped the game, so two conditions have to be met<br>in order for guess to run. inside the else if block there is<br>try and catch block to stop issues which number formatting problems and out<br>of bound from an array, it will broadcast a message of invalid input<br>to everyone and to try again. The code does not break from the<br>exception. There is a integer variable called x, which converts the string message<br>into a int by using Integer.parseInt(). The value inside Integer.parseInt() is message.split(&quot; &quot;)[1].<br>The split makes the message into an array and index each part of<br>the string based on white spaces, so &quot;Guess 1&quot; would be {&quot;Guess&quot;, &quot;1&quot;}.<br>Then [1] indicates that it is indexing to the second value of the<br>array which should be a number, in this case it would be 1.<br>So at the end of all x gets assigned that value from the<br>index.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>-There are if and else if conditions to check if the number was<br>guessed correctly or guessed incorrectly. The if condition checks if x (user guess)<br>== randomNum. Once its true, it broadcast the message the correct number and<br>mention which client got it right. Then it changes randomNum value to another<br>random number and broadcasts a message to guess between 1-10 again. The else<br>if checks if the guess is high or low, so x &gt; randomNum<br>|| x &lt; randomNum. Once this statement is true, there is a broadcast<br>saying it is an incorrect guess and mentions which user got it wrong<br>by client Id.</div><div><br></div><br></p><br></td></tr>

<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>For my second implementation I&nbsp; did coin flip<div><br></div><div>There is an else if block<br>that was added into process commend method for this to work. So the<br>else if condition looks for the word &quot;flip&quot; to start the coin toss.<br>Once it gets the message, there is an int variable called val that<br>gets a random number between 0 and 1. There are if and else<br>if conditions that check for either of the number. So if val ==<br>0, &quot;Head&quot; gets set to a variable called coinFace which is String data<br>type. CoinFace is a variable that is set as a private string which<br>has an empty string.&nbsp; If val == 1, than coinFace is set to<br>&quot;Tail&quot;.

<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>I had issues with how to implement number guesser since I did not<br>know how I would get the replies from the other clients to start<br>the game. To resolve this issue I visited officer hours for some help<br>and I learn how to implement for the homework. The help from the<br>professor made me understand how the client and server files worked a little<br>bit more and also helped me understand how to implement the second feature<br>which was coin flip.<br></p><br></td></tr>
